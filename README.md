**# Web Scraping Project – Book Data Extractor**

This project demonstrates a basic yet effective use of **Python-based web scraping** techniques to extract structured data from a website. The goal is to collect information about books listed on the "Books to Scrape" website (http://books.toscrape.com/), including:

- Title of the book  
- Price  
- Availability  
- Rating

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests`
  - `BeautifulSoup (bs4)`
  - `pandas`

### 📌 Key Features:
- Efficiently extracts book details across multiple pages.
- Handles pagination dynamically.
- Stores data in a clean tabular format using `pandas`.
- Outputs the scraped data to a CSV file for future use or analysis.

### 📈 Future Improvements:
- Integrate exception handling and logging.
- Add support for scraping additional metadata (e.g., UPC, product description).
- Convert the script into a web-based application or a CLI tool.

### 📁 Output:
The final dataset is stored in `books_data.csv`.
